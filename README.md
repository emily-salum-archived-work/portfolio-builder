# portfolio-builder

This program gets information about my projects, through [project_builder](), and uses it to create my portfolio page and send it to github.

## Technologies: 

Electron, Python

## Associated Projects:

- [github_init](https://github.com/emilymarquessalum/github_init) 
- [project_builder](https://github.com/emilymarquessalum/project_builder)


## State: 

Partially Complete 

### Completed Implementations (summarized):
- Creating the portfolio with data fetched from project_builder through python.
- Electron interface to handle and view the page before confirming it.
- Using github_init to send it to github 


### Incomplete Implementations:

- Currently, the portfolio itself must be modified for practical and aesthetic purpose, and therefore this project cannot be marked as complete as demand for it might change.
