# Portfolio Builder - Why?

I made portfolio builder because the alternative of loading data locally into a page
and hosting it statically was an interesting idea to me.

### For my portfolio, the benefits would be:

- I wouldn't have to deal with the HTML structure to add a new project, add a new language or technology that I learned.

- If I tried adding that via JS, there would be a lot more js code to simply load static data into the page. I didn't escape from js entirely, but it's a lot better the way I did it! 


## Current Functionality
- Creates the portfolio page using ejs.
- Opens an Electron Interface to view and mess with the page.
- github_init can be called via interface, to send the page to its repository.


# Conclussion

In a way, I added extra work for the creation of the portfolio, and for the functionalities to actually be worthit it there are still some crucial functionality missing. With all that aside, I am proud of the results. It's good to create things for the functionality, of course. But it's also fair to make it because it feels cool to have it.
